<div class="content">
  <p><h5>Since August 1st, 2017, the Women And Child Development Department of the Government of Maharashtra has been spearheading the implementation of the "Majhi Kanya Bhagyashree" initiative. This program, reflected in its name, is distinctly focused on empowering the girl child. In a country where regrettably, girls still face challenges like gender-based discrimination, honor-related violence, and early marriages, this initiative emerges as a progressive step. The Maharashtra government's decision to provide families with financial benefits after the birth of one or two daughters not only seeks to challenge societal norms but also aims to transform attitudes

<div class="content">
	<p><h5>In April 2016, the Maharashtra government has started a new scheme for the girl child across the state namely Mazi Kanya Bhagyashree Scheme. After the Rupashree Prakalpa in West Bengal and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme in Central, the Maharashtra state has taken an initiative to encourage the girl child education and quality of life of a woman by introducing this scheme. The said scheme has replaced the old scheme namely Sukanya, started in 2015.

<button class="collapsible"><h4>➢ BASIC IDEA:</h4></button>
<div class="content">
	<p><h5>Promoting the holistic progress of young girls, the Maharashtra government has introduced a commendable initiative offering financial support to economically disadvantaged families. This initiative aims to ensure the well-being of female children by addressing various crucial aspects. By providing financial assistance, the government seeks to tackle the prevalent issue of girls' education being cut short due to financial constraints. This initiative is anticipated to lead to a surge in the overall percentage of female education in the state, breaking down barriers to learning.

	</h5></p>
	<p><h5>Furthermore, the program targets the alarming gender gap in rural and remote areas by alleviating the perception of girls as burdens. With the financial aid offered, parents can now provide proper care and upbringing for their daughters, thereby contributing to the narrowing of the sex ratio gap.</h5></p>
    <p><h5>The scheme outlines specific financial provisions based on family circumstances. Families with a single female child will receive a transfer of Rs. 50,000, while those with two female children will be entitled to Rs. 25,000 for each child, fostering the well-being of both daughters.

	</h5></p>
	<p><h5>The initiative also promotes family planning, incentivizing families to opt for tubectomy or vasectomy after the birth of their second child. This approach serves to curb the birth rate and ensure the scheme's effectiveness

	</h5></p>
	<p><h5>Beneficiaries can access the financial support when the female child reaches the legal age of 18 years. Moreover, families in need of financial assistance for the development and education of their daughters can withdraw accrued interest after the child turns 6 or completes 12 years of age.

	</h5></p>
	<p><h5>To streamline the process, all monetary aid will be directly transferred to beneficiaries' bank accounts, which must be opened in the name of the female child and the mother in state-run banks. This approach ensures transparency and accessibility while encouraging financial inclusion.</h5></p>
